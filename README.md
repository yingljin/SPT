1. Do permutation test with t-statistics
2. Reduce grid to 32 by 32

1. Get rid of random effects. Repeat the procedure for only the two moving average errors.
- we'd like to figure out why the type I error is so far away from nominal values

1. Go along with the boostrap track. But calculated empirical quantiles and comapred to the observed value for rejection criterion
2. In boostrap, sample blocks with different sizes (like 3, 5, 7,...)
3. We can also simulation under the alternative hypothesis and see the coverage rate/power
